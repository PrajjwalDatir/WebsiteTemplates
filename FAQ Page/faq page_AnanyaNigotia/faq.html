                 Our entire belief lies in-"Give a hand to make the world better".We believe that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the process of development, sustainable change will not happen. Believing in this principle of 'Civic Driven Change' Smile Foundation sensitises the civil society in order to make them partners in its mission.

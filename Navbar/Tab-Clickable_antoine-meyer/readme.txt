Description of my project

I really like the paper folder effect with tabs. We often see this kind of files in police films. Thanks to the color effects, when you move from one tab to another, you have the impression of this effect where the leaves are on top of each other !

To use this very simple project, just run the index.html in your browser (personally I used VSCode to develop this code).
